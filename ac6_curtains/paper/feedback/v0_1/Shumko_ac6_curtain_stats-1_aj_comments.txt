Comments for AC6 Curtain Paper Draft April 2020. PDF has some highlights, all other comments are here. Hooray crashes for making me not trust my PDF reader.

Hi Mike,

As I told you a bunch of comments were lost when my pdf reader crashed so I instead switched to a txt file. The pdf I attached here has a few highlights that the txt file refers to but is mostly the same as what you sent me. Overall I feel the content is generally complete but theres a fair bit of work to do on organization and wording. To address your points in your email directly:

************************************************************************
I didn't actually have these points in mind as I read the paper, but I did leave a number of comments on this section that should help.
If I came up with questions I raised them in the comments. I think there were a few places you might add some things but over all I think you've covered the interesting statistical properties. From what I could tell the AE plot is not normalized because the occurrence rate of curtains goes down with AE yet you state it increases with AE suggesting the occurance rate falling is actually due to fewer samples at that AE. Normalizing by the AE distribution might improve the contribution.
Actually doing the math like this is a weak point of mine so I don't have a good sense of how much mu might change due to this acceleration. I don't see any issue in neglecting that change in mu so long as you clearly state why. You have a red sentence currently stating you assume the work done is small compared to the kinetic energy. You should include that and explicitly connect it to assuming mu doesn't change. I would place this between equations 1 and 2 and plainly state "we assume the work done on the electron is small compared to its kinetic energy and therefore set mu_i = mu_f" or something to that effect.
This is a tricky one to conclude because it's an initial study into something we don't know much about. Mostly this paper is "let's learn about curtains!" which makes it hard for the conclusion to be more than "we learned something!" You already address Blake and O'Brien's hypothesis as your one anchor to the rest of the literature, I think you might have to just live without that wow factor. This study would have been interesting regardless of your findings simply because we know nothing here.
Of course I'm happy to talk about any of my comments over email, or maybe we could set up a time to talk on the phone if that would be more helpful.

Unrelated to the curtain paper; I've gotten the full BARREL flight processed into csvs and plan to start an upload to box right now. I'll share a link tomorrow assuming the upload succeeds.
***********************************************************************

I noticed this first time through but missed it second time (sorry, no specific location, try a word search?): the difference between it's and its. It is a strange word in english because its contraction "it's" ALWAYS means "it is", a possesive like the earlier "its contraction" does not use an apostraphe. One of those crazy exceptions in this language.

Abstract
-Sentence 15-17: On first glance I read this as (paraphrased) "Curtains are precipitation phenomena observed on AC6". I'd move 'recently discovered' to where 'observed' is now, e.g. "Curtains are stationary, [...] precipitation phenomena recently discovered in low Earth [...]".
-line 17: "The > 30 keV electron curtains" is an awkward way of saying we're only looking at >30 keV electrons. Maybe mention somewhere AC6 only sees > 30 keV electrons instead, or you could probably just not state the energy range in the abstract.

Introduction
-Here, and throughout the paper: Take care in your language when describing curtains. You should be clear in your descriptions whether you're talking about curtains as a real phenomena or curtains as they appear in data. I'll point out specific examples when I notice them.
-line 33: "narrow in latitude, spiky" Are curtains spiky, or do they simply appear spiky in the data? Make it clear which you mean. Curtains (the real phenomena) are narrow in latitude which makes them appear spiky in the data when a spacecraft observes them while quickly crossing latitude. 'Narrow' and 'spiky' describe the same aspect of curtains from different points of view, they're not seperate qualities of a curtain. I would drop spiky in this sentence: "They are narrow in latitude and appear stationary for up to a minute [...]" and take a sentence or two later to explain why they appear spiky in the data.
-line 46: "also a spiky increase of electrons shorter than a second". Again, be careful to distinguish between data and real world. You've already established that curtains can last up to a minute, so how are microbursts "also shorter than a second"? ('also' implies curtains are shorter than a second.) This would be a great place to describe why curtains appear spiky in the data and then compare that to microbursts. Both appear spiky in the data for different reasons: Microbursts primarily for being temporally short, curtains primarily for being latitudianally small with a very fast observation platform.
-sentences 54-59: Good motivation for this study and would tie in well with an added discussion of why microbursts and curtains look similar.
-line 65: "shape of a curtain" I don't like this phrasing. We don't know what the shape of a curtain is after all, just a narrow cross section. Instead you should describe why this smearing in longitude would lead to spacecraft seeing it up to a minute apart and maybe comment on how the latitude stays narrow in this process.
-red question 65-67: Since the background on curtains is so sparse I think including another citation would be useful so long as you're certain they were looking at the same phenomena
-paragraphs 73-94: Overall these descriptions are good (but see some comments below), but they are far too detailed for the introduction section. By the time I finished them I had forgotten I was still reading the introduction where I should be learning about what curtains are. These paragraphs should be moved to another section. I think a good place for these would be either methodology, since you are using the BLC as a seperating criterion in your data, or in the results section when you first discuss the BLC curtains and how you calculated if AC6 was viewing the BLC.
-lines 75-79, highlighted sentences: These sentences pretty much say the same thing in different ways, one should be cut. I personally like the second one better (lines 77-79). This paragraph still reads pretty well if you simply cut the first highlighted sentence completely (lines 75-76) without additional changes. If you do retain the first highlighted sentence you should change 'magnetic field asymmetry' to 'weaker magnetic field'.
-sentence 80-82: The aside in commas makes this sentence a bit awkward, try to integrate the ideas such as "Particles with small enough pitch angles to be lost in the atmosphere within one bounce are in the BLC.
-sentence 82-83: I'd like the word define in here somewhere, such as "Traditionally, we define a particle with a mirror point at or below and altiude of 100 km to be in the BLC."
-paragraph 85-94: I would prefer to list the regions in a bit of a different order listing SAA (all populations observed), then north atlantic, (only BlC) then everywhere else (mix of BLC and DLC). This follows the typical logic of
if SAA:
if BLC:
else:
right now your sentence "In most regions, outside of the SAA and its conjugate point, AC6 will ovserve [...]" is awkward because you have to define 'most regions'. Leaving it until last means you can just say "In all other regions AC6 will observe [...]". I think you left BLC for last for the extra description that follows, but... (next comment)

-lines 90 -94: This description holds your hand way too much. This is how I might describe these concepts to my family or non-science friends. Just stating that the region is conjugate to the weaker magnetic field and lower mirror points in the SAA should be enough for your intended audience to understand why these particles must be in the BLC. In addition, if you move these paragraphs to the results section you'll also be describing quantitatively how you determined if AC6 is in the BLC which you can use to shore up your argument.

-red paragraph, 95-102: The quote you have here doesn't really describe what the BLC is or why it exists but rather describes the exact criteria Comess used to determine if SAMPEX was in the BLC, namely the local BLC must be large enough to fully include the FoV of both PET and HILT. You lay out your criteria later using IRBEM mapping. The only definition Comess offers is "the bounce loss cone is defined such that any electrons detected should precipitate on their next bounce". I think your description of why the BLC exists and why it's in the North Atlantic maybe isn't necessary, but it's also not out of place and I'm sure some new grad student will thank you for not assuming they know everything.

-paragraph 103-109: some repetition here stating twice you'll address the Blake and O'Brien hypothesis (highlighted).

Instrumentation
-line 118: typo; then -> them
-line 125: Why are we assuming an orbital velocity? Do we not know the correct value? As a quick calculation, if we're off on orbital speed by 50 m/s (<1%) then after a minute we'll be off by 3 km, or about 4 data points. Assuming a velocity makes your identifications at larger separations dubious. For example Figures 1c and 1d, at 26 seconds a 50 m/s error would mean panel d is wrong by about 2 data points. Would that still pass the criteria you've laid out for curtains?
-red text 136: yes, absolutely. Probably best to combine the separation distribution with another distributions such as Figure 2.

Methodology
-paragraphs 142-156: These should be combined into a single paragraph. Your criteria aren't complex enough to warrent an individual paragraph for each. lines 147-149 is especially sparse and doesn't stand on its own. See also a few comments for these paragraphs.
-sentence 143-145: Cut this sentence, it doesn't add anything. You've given the definition of "high spatial correlation" which your audience should know and just repeated that you want it to be spiky.
-sentence 150-152: your aside clarifying this criteria is only applied to those that pass the first is awkward. Reword something like: "The second criterion is applied to any features determined to be highly correlated to check if they are also spiky."
-line 156: add the word 'considered' before spiky, i.e. "[...] in other words [math], are considered spiky".
-sentence 157-158: No need to state the times were saved
-sentence 159-161: This sentence is a bit ambiguous in meaning. Earlier you've said we have 1634 candidates. I can't tell if this sentence is saying "all 1634 curtain candidates that met our criteria were confirmed to be curtains" or "of the N curtain candidates that met the criteria, 1634 of them were confirmed to be curtains".
-sentence 164-165: Both AC6 units do not need to see precipitation for it to be a microburst, this is a false statement. The top row of Figure 1 tells us nothing about whether it's a microburst or curtain.
-Figure 1: It would be helpful to have an example where the peaks that line up on the bottom are all fully visible on the top so readers can visualize the shift you're doing better. Panels a and b almost show this if the time plotted were just a little bit longer.
-line 166: why is that peculiar? Saying this is peculiar begs the question and looks out of place without a little comparison of how its peculiar. Since this is methodology you could just state the width and not bother with comparitive statements until results or discussion.

Results
-Sentence 175-176: This sentence is way out of place. It looks like it wants to conclude an outline paragraph, but this isn't an outline paragraph so it ends up just repeating question 3 and giving away the answer. A better transition into the rest of this section might be to remind the reader of the Blake and O'Brien hypothesis you're testing to explain why you'll be comparing to the Shumko microburst distribution. This might also work better if you don't enumerate the questions but instead comment on how each question tests the Blake and O'Brien hypothesis as you state them.

5.1 Curtain Width
-prominence definition 179-180: This is a good definition, but I confess if I hadn't recently been introduced to prominence I might not follow what you mean since I have limited experience with peak finding and terminology. I can't decide if a figure would be overboard or appropriate to help explain.
-"temporal width" lines 180-181: What do you mean by "temporal width"? You've already selected only those curtains that have high spatial correlation between the two units which implies there isn't much temporal variation during the time between the two AC6 units.
-"mostly in latitude" line 181: It's important to let your readers know this motion is mostly in latitude, but you should be a bit more explicit. Somewhere in this paragraph I want to see a few things explicitly stated: 1) Curtain "widths" are measured along the orbital track of AC6, 2) the motion of AC6 is primarily in latitude, and 3) therefore these widths are similar to the latitudinal width of curtains.
-typo line 187: much -> must
-paragraph 190-193: To my eye they're similar above 15 km but not below. Are you implying by this paragraph that the difference below 15 km can be entirely explained by the method of measuring? That is, if you somehow corrected for the bias introduced by the different methods of measurement would you expect the probability densities to be statistically identical? If so you should state that more explicitely rather than just imply it. If not you should spend a bit more time discussing the difference.

5.2 When and Where
-"normalized" line 196: normalized how?
-line 199: I don't think stating flag = 0 is necessary
-lines 200-202: I'm guessing you're not sure where to put this? Since this is results and you save the comparison to microbursts for later I think it can be attached to the end of the previous paragraph. That paragraph would describe Figure 3, then describes what Figure 3 tells us which seems like a good thread. Also, pare this down to just "The normalized distribution in Fig. 3b shows [...]" and make the normalization its own statement further up.
-Figure 3: Why are you using a different criteria for whether a bin should be plotted between panels a and b?
-Figure 3 caption: the panels are described awkwardly. My first attempt is: "Distribution of observed curtains by L shell and MLT. Panel a shows the locations of all curtains used in this study. Panel b shows the curtain distribution normalized by the number of 10 Hz samples taken in each bin, shown in panel c."
-line 206: you mention microbursts are in green but not that curtains are in blue (inconsistent)
-sentences 207-208: These feel like placeholder sentences that you're not sure how to word. Here's my first attempt: "Microburst and curtain observations are both associated with an enhanced AE. The occurance rate of microbursts increases with enhanced AE more than the occurance rate of curtains." (still not a fan, but hopefully that gives you some ideas to try)
-Figure 4: I'm not clear on how this plot was made. The black AE line is fairly self explanatory, but how were the blue and green lines calculated? Are these lines normalized by the AE distribution? If not, I'd like to see a normalized plot. If they are normalized, your claims in this section that curtains are observed with enhanced AE is false, in this plot enhanced AE is reducing the curtain observations.

5.3 Local Atmospheric Precipitation
-sentences 216-222: Most of these sentences are repetitive or overexplained. Recall you've already explained most of these concepts in the introduction (though I advised moving that section possibly to here). I would cut most of this. The only part I'd keep is noting the mirror point in the SAA is the upper bound since it corresponds to the magnetic field strength at AC6, but you do not need to explain this is true because particles mirroring at a higher altitude are not observed (obvious!). After the cut this would look like: "For each latitude-longitude point we traced that magnetic field line to the SAA and found the position along that field line with an equivalent field strength as in the North Atlantic. Since we are considering particles mirroring at the grid points in North Atlantic, this estimate is the upper bound altitude that the particle can mirror. If the corresponding field strength position is at 100 kilometers or lower in the SAA we considered that grid point in the North Atlantic in the BLC region." (see some minor comments to these sentences below as well)
-line 219: "grid points" -> "AC6 altitude"
-line 224: "the more rigorous" -> "a more rigorous"
-line 224: "saved" -> "also found"
-line 227-228: cut "at that location", redundant with earlier "north bound of the region"
-line 230: "set of latitude-longitude points" -> "boundary"
-lines 232-236: This discussion of how your BLC boundary compares to previous literature and magnetic field models fits better in the previous paragraph. I'd mention we're using O&P early in the paragraph where you first mention IRBEM-Lib. The rest of this would fit nicely at the end of that paragraph. That leaves this paragraph purely a description of Figure 5a leading nicely into the continued discussion in the following paragraph.
-lines 240-244: you're starting to get into the discussion here, the rest of this section has been a description of the observations without inference. These should probably be moved to section 6. Since this and the previous comment shorten the last two paragraphs here they might work better combined.
-line 242: "not drifting and were precipitating as much as 6 seconds as shown in Fig. 5e." There's a lot of concepts here just strung together, this could be 3-4 sentences.

Discussion
6.1 Curtain Width
-line 247: You haven't projected the AC6 orbit onto latitude as far as I've seen, so you do not know the width in latitude of these curtains. Your language earlier when first describing Figure 2 took care to mention the widths were mostly in latitude, but here Figure 2 is described to be latitudinal width exactly. I would suggest reminding the readers that Figure 2 is the widths along the AC6 orbit, which is mostly across latitude, then for the remainder of the section just use the word "width" without specifying latitude. The fact that AC6 does have some angle with latitude actually means the latitudinal size of these structures is probably smaller than what we measure.
-sentence 264-266: it looks like you're trying to qualitatively describe the effect this bias would have, but it's not clear what you mean by "the microburst size distribution is underestimated". Should we expect more microbursts of every size without this bias? You've clearly stated the Shumko 2019 result is a lower bound, I'm not sure further explanation is even necessary. If you think it is use language like "the size of microbursts is underestimated" or "this bias will overestimate the number of small microbursts". The size distribution has a few different pieces so stating it's underestimated is ambiguous.
-sentence 267-271: a lot of dancing around the point here. I'd cut it down to something like: "For curtains with a similar width to the detection algorithm’s 10-second baseline the baseline will be artificially elevated making the curtain peak less pronounced."
-line 272: "wider curtains" It looks like Figure 2 cuts out around 45 km for curtains, about 6 seconds of data which is certainly similar to your baseline. Did you ever try a longer baseline for detection? It's not necessary if you haven't, but if you have it would be worth mentioning how a longer baseline changes Figure 2 (hopefully not much).
-lines 274-275: I don't like the word agrees here, though it's not wrong per se. Your earlier wording "it's resonable to believe that curtains and microbursts are related" (lines 257-258) sits better, qualitatively describing some biases should not upgrade that to agreement. I'd expect the curtain width bias to be small, if it weren't you presumably would have chosen a longer baseline. It's not clear how big the microburst size bias might be (as you point out it's hard). I think it's resonable to claim these biases would not significantly change the interpretation of Figure 2, just the wording "agrees with" feels too strong.
-lines 277-279: "belt, and observed" -> "belt and is observed" (drop comma if you didn't notice that part).

6.2 when and where
-line 278: "evening" and "morning". You've probably used these terms this way earlier, I just now had this thought though. Using the terms "evening" and "morning" are correct, and quickly identify what region of Figure 3 you're referring too. I think you should rethink how you refer to these regions in the context of other literature, however. Typically we say microbursts are most common in the "morning" which refers to a wide region from 22ish-noonish, but mostly in the MLTs where AC6 has no data. You say here curtains are observed relatively more in the evening than the morning, but also say the distribution is similar to that of microbursts citing papers that probably say microbursts are observed relatively more in the morning (see the issue?). I'd prefer adopting "near midnight" and "late morning" (or similar) like you use later in this paragraph throughout the paper.

-explanation starting line 286: I like this explanation, makes simple intuitive sense without too much reaching outside the evidence

6.3 curtains in the BLC
-line 298: "likewise" -> "therefore"
-sentence 299-300: rewording or previous statement in parenthesis. Cut one, I'd prefer cutting the parenthesis and leaving this sentence.
-line 301: "potential potential"
-line 302: "at a magnetic" -> "with a magnetic"
-line 304: "Now when" -> "When"
-line 305: no comma
-line 304: define phi
-red sentence 306-307: why is this red? I think it should be pointed out somewhere that we're making this assumption
-equation 2: should this be W_i? if not, explain why the subscript was dropped in the text
-line 312: additional comma after B_f
-sentence lines 320-322: interesting point described awkwardly. Perhaps drop AC6 from this sentence and describe what a generic mission would need to test this potential relationship. Something like "A possible relationship between curtains and inverted-V structures could be explored with coordinated measurements  of <30 keV." (better yet, state the actual energy range)

Conclusions
line 337: Maybe being picky, but this isn't a statistical inference
line 337: Just had this thought, doesn't really apply to this line in particular. One suggestion we've presented is that an electric field could cause an electron that mirrors at 100 km in the SAA to still reach the altitude of AC6. After bouncing in the north wouldn't that electron pass backward through the electric field and once again mirror at 100 km in the SAA? If that's the case this electron is currently part of the trapped population since it mirrors at or above 100 km in both hemispheres. For this electron to be lost in the north would require an even stronger electric field to push the electron below 100 km and we've already assumed it won't be lost in the south. All this would imply that a persistent curtain observation in the BLC does not necessarily mean there's continuous precipitation going on as stated here, these particles might actually be fully trapped. It would also provide a mechanism for a drifting remnant of a microburst to enter the SAA longitudes without being lost meaning these BLC observations could be consistent with the Blake and O'Brien hypothesis. I'd be curious to hear what Paul or someone else thinks of that.

Homeless words: None of these feel like they fill a gap you've left, so you don't need to find a home for any of these. Some might help address comments as a different way of explaining something. I'd stay away from calling the "north atlantic region conjugate to the SAA" the "BLC" in the paper (you've done that well already, just saying don't put in the other version). For your parting questions, curtains shifting slightly could be due to the magnetic field stretching or compressing perhaps? I also think back to my point earlier about assuming the orbital velocity, perhaps they don't line up will because the actual velocity is different enough from 7.5 km/s to matter. Are the shifted curtains typically observed at larger separations? That wouldn't prove it's a velocity error since any cause of movement will be more apparent if you take longer between measurements, but it might be worth checking the actual velocity of a few of these cases to see if that corrects it.
