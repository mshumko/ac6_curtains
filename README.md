# ac6_curtains

This project is a follow-on to the ac6_microburst_scale_sizes project to study 
the statistical properties of curtains (narrow latitudinal structures observed 
by AC-6).

The first analysis attempt will define curtains to be less than a second wide in
the 10 Hz time series (< 7.5 km latitudinal extent). Then the curtain occurance
rate just to the east and west of the SAA will be estimated to test the hypothesis
from Blake et al., 2016 that curtains are remants of microbursts in the drift 
loss cone. The last thing I plan to investigate (as of now) is how the amplitude
of curtains change between the leading and trailing spacecraft.
