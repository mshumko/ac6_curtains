\begin{abstract}
Curtains are recently discovered stationary, persistent, and narrow in latitude electron precipitation phenomena observed in low Earth orbit over sequential passes of the dual AeroCube-6 CubeSats. The $> 30$ keV electron curtains were stationary over a variety of spacecraft separations, observed by the follower spacecraft up to 65 seconds after the leader. This study expands the recent curtain discovery and quantifies statistical properties of 1634 curtains observed over three years. We found that in low Earth orbit, many curtains are narrower than 10 kilometers in latitude and 90\% are less than 21 kilometers wide. We also found that curtains are an outer radiation belt phenomena that are observed in the late morning and midnight magnetic local time, with a higher occurrence rate at midnight. Furthermore curtains are observed more often at lower geomagnetic activity than microbursts.  We compare every statistical result to microbursts to test the hypothesis that curtains are drifting remnants of microbursts. Lastly, we found a few curtains in the bounce loss cone region in the north Atlantic Ocean where drift mission is impossible. In one example, a curtain was continuously scattered for at least six seconds so curtains can be a significant source of $> 30$ keV electrons into the atmosphere.

\section{Plain Language Summary}

\section{Introduction}
Curtains are a stationary electron precipitation phenomena observed in low Earth orbit (LEO). They are narrow in latitude, spiky, and appear stationary for up to a minute between subsequent satellite passes. \citeA{Blake2016} recently discovered curtains with the $> 30$ keV electron dosimeters onboard the dual AeroCube-6 (AC6) CubeSats that operated together between 2014 and 2017. This discovery was possible due to AC6's actively maintained in-track separation between a few hundred meters and a few hundred kilometers. Besides the \citeA{Blake2016} discovery study not much is known about curtains including what they are, how are they generated, their statistical properties, and their impact on the atmosphere. Answering these questions is an essential next step towards a more complete understanding of how curtains, and particle precipitation in general, affect the magnetosphere and Earth.

Recently developed multi-spacecraft missions, such as AC6, are necessary to identify and distinguish curtains from similar-looking transient precipitation called electron microbursts. Microbursts have been observed since mid 1960s by high altitude balloons and satellites and are also a spiky increase of electrons shorter than a second but are not spatially stationary \cite<e.g.>{Anderson1964, Lorentzen2001a, O'Brien2003, Douma2017}. The  companion study to this work by \citeA{Shumko2020} calculated the spatial size of microbursts using simultaneous observations of microbursts observe by AC6. The impact of microbursts on the environment is substantial. \citeA{Thorne2005}, \citeA{Douma2019}, and \citeA{Breneman2017}---among others---estimated that microbursts can deplete the outer radiation belt electrons in about a day. Furthermore, \citeA{Seppala2018} modeled a 6 hour microburst storm and concluded that microbursts depleted mesospheric ozone by roughly 10\%. Thus, it is important to understand the connection, if any, between microbursts and curtains. Curtains and microbursts can be easily misidentified from a single spacecraft so we need to reevaluate single-satellite microburst studies. If curtains are numerous then the estimated microburst occurrence rates are overestimated. Furthermore, the microburst impact on the atmosphere and the outer radiation belt is also overestimated.

\citeA{Blake2016} proposed the following hypothesis that explains curtain-microburst relationship. If a microburst is not completely lost in the atmosphere after the initial scatter, the remaining microburst electrons will spread out (bounce phase average) along the entire magnetic field line. At the same time these electrons drift to the east, with faster energy electrons drifting at a faster rate, so the initially localized microburst is smeared in longitude into the shape of a curtain. \textcolor{red}{Maybe cite the curtain paper from 2000 that relates them to lightning? Title: Trapped energetic electron curtains produced by thunderstorm driven relativistic runaway electrons.}

AC6 does not have the necessary pitch angle, $\alpha$, resolution to differentiate between drifting and precipitating electrons to test the \citeA{Blake2016} hypothesis. Instead we use AC6's position and Earth's asymmetric magnetic field to differentiate particles that are either nearly-trapped or immediately lost in the drift loss cone, and particles immediately lost in the bounce loss cone (BLC). These concepts are described below.

Earth's magnetic field is spatially shifted towards Singapore which creates a region of weaker magnetic field in the South Atlantic Ocean called the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The magnetic field asymmetry caused by the SAA allows barely-trapped particles, defined by a mirror point just above Earth's atmosphere, to mirror much closer to Earth's surface and be lost in the SAA. The barely-trapped particles that are able to execute bounce and drift motion everywhere except the SAA and its conjugate point are in the drift loss cone. The drift loss cone defines a set of $\alpha$ between the trapped and bounce loss cone pitch angles. The particles with pitch angle smaller than the bounce loss cone are unable to complete a full bounce before they are lost in the atmosphere. The convention defining the loss cone is a mirror point at or below 100 kilometer altitude. In this study we will use this definition as well as a more strict convention of a mirror point below sea level.

Without pitch angle resolution, we use AC6's location in LEO to isolate particles that are trapped, barely-trapped, and immediately lost. Above the SAA, AC6 will observe, but not differentiate, particles that are trapped, barely-trapped, and immediately precipitating. In the region outside of the SAA and it's conjugate point, AC6 will observe particles barely trapped in the drift loss cone and immediately precipitating in the bounce loss cone. Lastly, the region in the North Atlantic that is magnetically conjugate to the SAA is the bounce loss cone. Here AC6 only observes particles precipitating within a bounce period ($\approx 1.5$ second for 30 keV electrons). If a particle makes it to AC6's altitude, it can gyrate past AC6 and precipitate in the North Atlantic. Alternatively, the particle will mirror at or below AC6 and gyrate into the SAA where the equivalent mirror point magnetic field strength is deep in the atmosphere, or below sea level. Thus the particle is lost. Therefore, any precipitation structures observed in the bounce loss cone region must rapidly precipitate.

\textcolor{red}{Think about how Max Comess explained the BLC. Am I going overboard?... The bounce loss region is defined as
where the field of view of the PET and HILT detectors are
fully within the bounce loss cone, where the bounce loss cone
is defined such that any electrons detected should precipitate
on their next bounce, ensuring that any particles viewed by
SAMPEX in this region are not trapped, nor were they
scattered into the loss cone at a substantially different MLT
than SAMPEX’s location. These criteria put SAMPEX in
the north Atlantic (Figure 1), conjugate to the outer-belt
portion of the South Atlantic Anomaly [see, e.g., Dietrich
et al., 2010, Figure 3].}

This study expands the \citeA{Blake2016} study by estimating statistical properties of curtains and address the \citeA{Blake2016} hypothesis. We use 1634 confirmed curtain observations to learn about the distributions of: the curtain width in latitude, the geomagnetic conditions favorable to curtains, and curtain distribution in L and magnetic local time (MLT). Lastly we will address the hypothesis that curtains are drifting remnants of microbursts by showing examples of curtains observed in the bounce loss cone region.

\iffalse
\textcolor{red}{---OLD--- In LEO an observed particle with a local pitch angle, $\alpha$, smaller than the local loss cone pitch angle, $\alpha_{lc} \approx 60^\circ$ will travel towards its mirror point at an altitude below 100 kilometers. At these altitudes collisions with the atmosphere are numerous and the particle is likely to be lost within one bounce period. Particles with $\alpha > \alpha_{lc}$ are not immediately lost, rather they are lost in the SAA once they drift into it (technically some particles observed in the SAA are trapped).}

\textcolor{red}{---OLD--- With one spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO), moving at a typical 7.5 km/s velocity, it is impossible to differentiate between a microburst that moves past the spacecraft in less than a second (temporal), and a stationary spiky feature that the spacecraft moves through in less than a second (spatial). Two identically-instrumented spacecraft orbiting in proximity can differentiate between the two types of precipitation. One such mission is the dual AeroSube-6 (AC6) CubeSats that measured electrons and protons together in LEO between 2014 and 2017. With AC6 both structures were readily observed and studied: microbursts in \citeA{Shumko2020}, and recently discovered stationary, narrow, and spiky precipitation features called curtains that were first reported by \citeA{Blake2016}. This study expands on \citeA{Blake2016} and shows statistical properties of curtains and compares them to microbursts studied in the \citeA{Shumko2020} companion study.}

\textcolor{red}{---OLD--- Besides a brief description of curtains in \citeA{Blake2016}, not much is known about about them. \citeA{Blake2016} proposed an outstanding hypothesis that curtains are remnants of microbrusts that are not completely scattered into the atmosphere and over time the packet of microburst electrons is smeared out (bounce phase averaged) along the magnetic field line between the two hemispheres. Since different energy electrons drift around the Earth at different speeds, the electrons are not only smeared out along one field line, but also stretched out along the electron drift orbit into a curtain shape. In most regions in LEO where AC6 observes curtain electrons, these electrons are drifting east in the drift loss cone until they are scattered in the atmosphere in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The SAA is a region where Earth's magnetic field is weakest near the surface, caused by the spatial offset of Earth's magnetic field. A related region, magnetically conjugate to the SAA is the bounce loss cone (BLC). Traditionally, the BLC is defined as the North Atlantic region where if an electron is observed in LEO, it will either precipitate in the atmosphere below the spacecraft, or mirror at the spacecraft altitude and then potentially mirror at or below 100 km altitude in the SAA. At sub-100 kilometer altitude, collisions with the atmosphere are numerous and the particle will be lost. In this study we will assume this definition and a more strict definition that the particle will mirror at or below sea level in the SAA---in other words the particle is surely lost.}

\textcolor{red}{---OLD--- The concept of the bounce loss cone (BLC) pitch angle is traditionally defined as the pitch angle of a particle that will mirror at or below 100 km where collisions with the atmosphere become more numerous and the particle is likely to be lost within one bounce period. The BLC pitch angle, however small, is always defined but most LEO spacecraft do not have the angular resolution to identify particles that will be immediately lost. A particle can also be pseudo-trapped if it has a pitch angle between the BLC and the drift loss cone. A particle with a pitch angle smaller than the drift loss cone and larger than the BLC will locally mirror above 100 km and drift around the Earth until the altitude of the mirror point magnetic field descends below 100 km in the SAA and the particle is lost. For pitch angles greater than the drift loss cone, the particle is considered trapped.}

\textcolor{red}{---OLD--- While AC6 does not have PA information, it is instructive to consider the affect of particle PA, on AC6 observations and if the particle is immediately lost. Assume the equatorial PA of electrons that mirror at AC6's altitude by $\alpha_0$. Then if an electron has $\alpha > \alpha_0$ then that electron may be trapped and will not be observed by AC6 in the BLC. The other condition, $\alpha < \alpha_0$ means that the electron will either precipitate below AC6 or mirror below AC6 in the northern hemisphere and then bounce to the southern hemisphere and precipitate in the atmosphere.}

\textcolor{red}{---OLD--- Without the angular resolution necessary to study the particles in the BLC and DLC, the geographic location of the LEO spacecraft can be used to exclude certain particle populations. In the SAA, a LEO satellite observes particles all three particle motions: trapped, drifting in the DLC, or immediately lost. Outside of the SAA and the BLC a LEO spacecraft observes particles lost within one drift, or immediately. Lastly BLC region conjugate to the SAA only immediately precipitating particles are observed in LEO. For most locations outside of the SAA, a LEO statecraft does not observe trapped particles and thus observes particles in the DLC and BLC. Those particles must be lost soon but the question remains if the particles are lost immediately or when they drift into the SAA. The region magnetically conjugate to the SAA in the north Atlantic ocean in also confusingly called the BLC. In the BLC region a particle either precipitates below the satellite, or mirror just below the satellite and precipitate in the SAA, where the particle’s mirror point in the SAA’s reduced magnetic field strength is lower in the atmosphere. In other words, the electron will be lost to the atmosphere. Thus in the BLC region any observed particle is lost within a bounce period (≈ 1 second for 30 keV electrons). Since AC6 does not have angular resolution, BLC will only refer to the north Atlantic region.}

\textcolor{red}{---OLD--- Without pitch angle resolution, we will use AC6's location above Earth to distinguish between drifting and immediately precipitating particles. This is made possible because Earth’s magnetic field is asymmetric which creates a region of weaker magnetic field in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA).}

\textcolor{red}{---OLD--- I propose to test this question using Earth’s asymmetric magnetic field which creates a region of weaker magnetic field in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). A related region, magnetically conjugate to the SAA in the North Atlantic, is the bounce loss cone (BLC). The BLC and the SAA are critical to test the proposed science question. A particle observed in LEO and in the BLC will precipitate within one bounce period (≈ 1 second for 35 keV electrons). The electron will either precipitate below the satellite, or mirror just below the satellite and travel into the SAA, where the particle’s mirror point in the SAA’s reduced magnetic field strength is deep in the atmosphere. In other words, the electron will transfer its energy and be lost to the atmosphere.}

\section{Instrumentation} \label{instrumentation}
The AC6 mission was a pair of 0.5U (10x10x5 cm) CubeSats built by The Aerospace Corporation designed to measure the electron and proton environment in low Earth orbit \cite{O'brien2016}. AC6 was launched on 19 June 2014 into a 620x700 km, $98^\circ$ inclination orbit. The AC6 orbit over the three year mission lifetime was roughly dawn-dusk, and precessed only a few hours in MLT; 8-12 MLT in dawn and 20-24 MLT in dusk. The two AC6 spacecraft, designated as AC6-A and AC6-B, separated after launch and were in proximity for the duration of the three year mission---maintained by an active attitude control system. The attitude control system allowed then to precisely control the amount of atmospheric drag experienced by each AC6 unit using the surface area of their solar panel ``wings". By changing their orientation, AC6 was able to maintain a separation between 2-800 km, confirmed with the Global Positioning System. The two AC6 units were in a string of pearls configuration so one unit, typically unit A, was leading the other by an in-track lag---the time it would take the following spacecraft to catch up to the position of the leading spacecraft. To convert between the AC6 in-track separation and in-track lag, we assume a typical 7.5 km/s orbital velocity of LEO spacecraft. The in-track lag was readily available with the Global Positioning System which makes it easy to study precipitation phenomena observed at the same time, and at the same position by shifting one time series by the in-track lag.

Each AC6 unit contains three Aerospace microdosimeters (licensed to Teledyne Microelectronics, Inc) that measure the electron and proton dose in orbit \cite{O'brien2016}. The dosimeter used for this study is dos1 with a $30$ keV electron threshold. dos1 is used for this study because the other dosimeters were not identical between unit A and B. All dosimeters sample at 1 Hz in survey mode, and 10 Hz in burst mode. 10 Hz data was readily available from both AC6 units from June 2014 to May 2017 while their in-track lag was less than 65 seconds, and at times was a fraction of a second. \textcolor{red}{Show a distribution of the in-track lag when they had 10 Hz data?} The variety of AC6 separations and data availability over the three-year mission makes it possible to study tranisent electron microburst precipitation \cite{Shumko2020} and now stationary electron curtain precipitation.

\section{Methodology} 
\subsection{Curtain Identification} \label{curtain_identification}
\textcolor{blue}{
Outline
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mention that various parameters were explored and we tuned it to have as many candidate events as possible while being feasible to inspect every detection. 
\end{enumerate}
}

The 10 Hz data was used to identify curtains with the following two criteria: a high spatial correlation, and spiky. The first criterion quantifies the similarity of the feature between both AC6 units, and the second criterion checks that highly correlated times were spiky. Before we we applied the identification criteria, the AC6-B time series was shifted by the in-track lag to spatially align it with the AC6-A time series. 

The first identification criterion is a 1-second rolling Pearson correlation applied to both time series. Spatial features with a correlation greater than 0.8 were considered highly correlated and saved.

The second identification criterion checks for locations where both AC6 units observed spiky precipitation. Similar to how precipitation bands were identified in \citeA{Blum2015} and microbursts in \citeA{Greeley2019}, we find spiky precipitation by estimating the number of Poisson standard deviations, $\sigma$, that a dos1 count rate is above a centered 10-second running average, $B_{10}$. Locations where the count rates are at least two $\sigma$ above $B_{10}$ are spiky. 

The locations where the two criteria are met are curtain candidates and the time of the peak count rates are saved. To check the quality of the data set, one author visually checked every candidate curtain and 1634 curtains were confirmed. Four curtain examples are shown in Fig. \ref{fig1}. In these examples the unmodified time series is in the top row and the corresponding spatially-aligned time series is in the bottom row. The in-track lag used to shift the bottom row is annotated by $dt$, corresponding to an AC6 in-track separation annotated by $s$. The top row is uncorrelated; thus these events were not microbursts. The bottom row is correlated after 3 to 26 seconds. The correlated curtains in the bottom row are peculiar---they have a fine structure on a 10-kilometer scale that we have shown to persist for at least 26 seconds.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1.pdf}
\caption{Four examples showing the AC6 $> 30$ keV electron data taken by AC6 at the same time in the top row and at the same position in the bottom row. AC6-A, whose data is shown with red curves, was $s$ kilometers ahead of AC6-B. To show the data at the same position the time series data from one spacecraft was shifted by the in-track lag and annotated by dt. These examples show curtain precipitation that was highly correlated for up to 26 seconds.}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\section{Results} \label{results}
In the spirit of brevity, we limited the scope of this statistical study to answer three questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item How narrow are curtains?
\item When and where are curtains observed?
\item Are curtains drifting or locally precipitating?
\end{enumerate} For each of these questions we will compare the curtain distribution with the $>30$ keV microburst distribution from \citeA{Shumko2020}. Lastly, we will show evidence that suggests that some curtains are continuously scattered and not drifting.

\subsection{Curtain Width}
We quantified curtain width in time as the width at half of the curtain's topographic prominence: the height of the peak above the lowest contour that encircles the peak but contains no higher peak. The spatial width of a curtain is the product of the temporal width and the 7.5 km/s orbital velocity mostly in latitude. The distribution of curtain widths is shown in Fig. \ref{width_dist} by the thick black curve. Curtains are very narrow in latitude. Many curtains are less than 10 km wide, and 90\% are narrower than 21 km.
	
We compared the curtain width distribution to the microburst size distribution estimated in \citeA{Shumko2020}. \citeA{Shumko2020} estimated the microburst size distribution by finding microbursts that were observed simultaneously by both AC6 units so the microburst size much be larger than the AC6 separation. The red curve in Fig. \ref{width_dist} shows the microburst distribution estimated from the ratio of the number of concurrent and nonconcurrent microbursts observed in each separation bin. 

The curtain and microburst size distributions are very similar with a one notable difference. Curtain widths are observed directly hence their distribution is peaked, while the microburst distribution is estimated from concurrent observations so their distribution is peaked at 0 km AC6 separation.

\subsection{When and Where Are Curtains Observed}
The distribution of curtains in L and MLT is shown in Fig. \ref{l_mlt_dist}. Figure \ref{l_mlt_dist}a shows the distribution of the 1634 observed curtains and Fig. \ref{l_mlt_dist}b shows the normalized distribution. The white bins, mostly in the early morning and evening MLT regions, had no observed curtains because the AC6 orbit did not sample there. Figure \ref{l_mlt_dist}c confirms this by showing the distribution of the number of quality (data quality flag = 0) 10 Hz samples.

After scaling by the uneven sampling in the late morning and midnight MLT regions, the normalized distribution in Fig. \ref{l_mlt_dist}b shows enhanced curtain occurrence in the outer radiation belt in late morning and midnight MLT regions. The highest curtain occurrence rate is near midnight while the microburst peak occurrence rate is in the late morning MLT \cite<e.g.>{O'Brien2003, Douma2017}.

Now we quantify the geomagnetic conditions favorable for curtains. Figure \ref{ae_dist} shows the distribution of the Auroral Electroject (AE) index between 2014 and 2017, and the distribution of the AE index when curtains and microbursts were observed. The distribution of the AE index when $> 30$ keV microbursts were observed is shown with a dashed green curve. Curtains are observed typically when AE is enhanced. Microbursts are observed when AE is enhanced more than for curtains.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Local Atmospheric Precipitation}
Now we will show examples of curtains that were scattered over an extended period of time in the bounce loss cone. We estimated the bounce loss cone region in the North Atlantic Ocean using the IRBEM-Lib magnetic field library \cite{irbem}. First we estimated the local magnetic field strength on a latitude-longitude grid spanning the North Atlantic, at 700 kilometer altitude that is typical for AC6. For each latitude-longitude point we traced that magnetic field line to the SAA and found the position along that field line with an equivalent field strength as in the North Atlantic. A particle that mirrors at the grid location will mirror and gyrate to the southern hemisphere before mirroring at an altitude with the eqivulant field strength or be lost in the atmosphere. Since we are considering particles mirroring at the grid points in North Atlantic, this estimate is the upper bound altitude that the particle can mirror. Particles mirroring above the grid will not be observed, and the particles that are observed will mirror at or below the estimated altitude in the SAA. If the corresponding field strength position is at 100 kilometers or lower in the SAA we considered that grid point in the North Atlantic in the bounce loss cone region. For the more rigorous bounce loss cone criteria, we saved the grid locations where the equivalent field strength altitude in the SAA is below sea level. 


Figure \ref{fig3}a shows a map of the bounce loss cone region in the North Atlantic. The solid blue line is the north bound of the region where a particle observed at 700 kilometers at that location will mirror at 100 kilometers in the SAA. Immediately south of the solid blue line the SAA mirror altitude rapidly decreases towards, and below, sea level. The dashed blue line is the set of latitude-longitude points where the SAA mirror point altitude is at sea level. Furthermore we superposed two dotted black lines on Fig. \ref{fig3}a that represent the boundary of the outer radiation belt defined between L shells of 4 and 8. The bounce loss cone region here closely matches the region shown in \citeA[Figure 1]{Comess2013} and \citeA[Figure 3]{Dietrich2010}. We used the Olson-Pfitzer magnetic field model \cite{Olson1982} to estimate the bounce loss cone boundary. The same analysis using the Tsyganenko 1989 model \cite{Tsyganenko1989} yielded similar boundaries. 

We found four good curtains that were observed inside the bounce loss cone regions and included the shifted time series plots in Fig. \ref{fig3}b-e, with the AC6 in-track lag, L and MLT of the observations annotated. The AC6 locations where these curtains were observed are shown in \ref{fig3}a with red stars and the corresponding panel labels. The curtains shown in Fig. \ref{fig3}c and e were observed near the sea level SAA mirror altitude curve thus they were not drifting and were precipitating as much as 6 seconds as shown in Fig. \ref{fig3}e. For reference, the precipitation persisted for longer than the typical $\approx 1.5$ second bounce period of 30 keV electrons in this region.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig3.pdf}
\caption{Curtains observed inside the bounce loss cone region. Panel a shows a map of the North Atlantic region with the outer radiation belt, defined by an L shell range between 4 and 8, shown with the dotted black curves. The solid blue curve shows the northern boundary of the bounce loss cone region. Along this curve, electrons observed at a 700 kilometer altitude in the North Atlantic will mirror at 100 kilometers in the SAA. A more strict bounce loss cone criteria is the dashed blue curve that represents a mirror point altitude at sea level in the SAA. The 4 red stars with labels show the locations of the curtain examples shown in panels b-e. The panels b-e show the 4 example curtains with the AC6-A shown by the red line, and AC6-B with the blue line. AC6-A was ahead in all examples except panel d.}

\section{Discussion} \label{discussion}
\textcolor{blue}{
Outline
\begin{enumerate}
\item Curtains are latitudinally narrow and must be around a few hundred km at the equator. Whatever they are they keep their shape for multiple seconds
\item curtain phenomena originates in the outer radiation belt, and observed relatively more in the evening than morning regions. Limited AC6 coverage prevents a complete MLT distribution
\item preference to disturbed conditions
\item To explain the randomness in the leading/following spacecraft count rates. If curtains are microburst remnants and the microburst electrons were recently scattered, then those electrons are not yet mixed homogeneously among the field line. With AC6 the leading and trailing spacecraft will observe a part of the spread out packet. Assuming the microburst had a falling energy spectrum, the leading spacecraft could see a smaller number of higher energy electrons, or a higher number of low energy electrons.
\item some curtains locally precipitate for an extended period of time so there must be a sustained parallel electric field. Show the derivation and estimated potential.
\item AC6 can't answer this question, but curtains could provide a substantial source of HOx and NOX molecules responsible for destroying ozone. We need AC6 with energy and pitch angle resolution.
\end{enumerate}}

If curtains are remnants of microbursts then the distribution of curtain widths in latitude corresponds to the microburst size distribution. Figure \ref{width_dist} shows a good correspondence between the distribution of curtain widths in latitude and the microburst size distribution from \citeA{Shumko2020}. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that curtains and microbursts are related, but this result need to be closely inspected for sources of bias. 

The microburst scale size distribution, as described in \citeA{Shumko2020}, is the fraction of microbursts observed simultaneously to all microbursts observed either simultaneously or by only one AC6 unit. A microburst observed simultaneously must be larger than the spacecraft separation so the microburst distribution represents a lower bound. \citeA{Shumko2020} attempted to account for this bias but it is difficult. This bias that shifts the microburst distribution to smaller sizes so in the microburst size distribution shown in Fig. \ref{width_dist} is underestimated.

Furthermore the detection algorithm described in section \ref{curtain_identification} has a width bias. For wide curtains with a similar width to the detection algorithm's 10-second baseline, the 10-second baseline is then calculated using the enhanced curtain counts instead of the background and is increased above the true background and thus the curtain peak is less pronounced relative to the baseline. As a result, the curtain detection algorithm is less sensitive to wider curtains. The result of this bias is similar to the bias inherent in the microburst distribution---the curtain widths are underestimated.

Now we address curtains observed in the bounce loss cone. What can cause continuous, $>30$ keV electron precipitation observed for multiple seconds? The precipitation mechanism responsible must be radially localized near the magnetic equator, on a scale of a few hundred kilometers. One potential driver is a parallel DC electric field that lowers the mirror point to AC6 altitudes. We now estimate the minimum potential that can accelerate these curtain electrons and lower the mirror point. We assume the particle is initially just trapped with a mirror point at 100 kilometers in the SAA. This condition implies that the particle's mirror point in the bounce loss cone is above AC6.

Title: Statistical Properties of Curtains--Latitudinally-Narrow and Persistent Electron Precipitation Phenomena

This study leverages AC6, a multi-spacecraft mission, to interpret and understand particle precipitation in a way that is impossible with a single spacecraft.

This study leverages the asymmetry in Earth's magnetic field. The asymmetric magnetic field results in the SAA and the BLC, two very related and unique regions

Particles that impact the atmosphere are lost during that bounce motion. We found curtains in the bounce loss cone, a region in the North Atlantic near and above Iceland.

The bounce loss cone is magnetically connected to the SAA, where Earth's magnetic field is weakest near Earth's surface. A particle observed in the blc in the northern hemisphere will descend below 100 km altitude. At sub-100 km altitudes the particle has a high chance of encountering and scattering with the atmosphere and be lost. 

We found curtain electrons that, when given the chance to execute their cyclical bounce motion, will descend below Earth's surface in the SAA. An electrons can not survive that trip.

Write the paper and ask the question: "What is this paper really about?" Not just curtains, but uncovering something unexpected that has been observed and overlooked for decades.

Are curtains related to aurora? This is a good question---one that is not pertinent here (idea from The Elements of Style p.68).

Here are two parting questions that are not considered here. Why were some curtains shifted slightly? Perhaps it was due to the movement of the magnetic field lines. Also do curtains have a corresponding visual signature on the ground? The answer to this question will show if curtains are related to the aurora.
