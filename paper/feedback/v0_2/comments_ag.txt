Hey Mike,

 

Looks good! I like all the edits you’ve made. The only things I might suggest at this point is adding one sentence at the end of section 5.1 to say why you’re comparing the microbursts and curtain distribution. “Comparing these shows that the distributions are distinct and different populations” or whatever. Just to wrap up that section. Nice work, I think it’s ready to go.
